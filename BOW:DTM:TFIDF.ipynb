it could not have escaped the mods notice that th brigade headquarters defenses were collapsing at the time nevertheless control of public perception seems to have been the overriding concern the sla spokesman sarath munesinghe was quoted as saying there were casualties on both sides and we still dont know the exact details shortly afterwards the mod issued its first casualty claim: sri lankans killed soldiers sailors and special forces commandos this was accompanied by a claim that ltte casualties had to be heavy though no basis was given this conclusion later this was qualified: tigers had been killed in addition the size of the attacking force was now stated to be late on tuesday the mod said that sri lankans had died and that terrorist transmissions indicated tigers had died the mod also said that sri lankans were wounded the situation was said to be under control and the troops were said to be engaged in clearing operations however vavuniya residents told news agency reporters that they could hear the sound of heavy fighting to the north including artillery thandikulum is a few miles north of vavuniya an aid worker told agency reporter that the ltte was still holding parts of thandikulum the road from vavuniya to thandikulum remained sealed military officials also admitted to agency reporters that the th brigade hq had been overrun the ltte issued a statement late on tuesday stating that its troops were still holding thandikulum it also stated that it had killed hundreds of soldiers whilst losing tigers on the following day the mod had a new set of numbers: the number of tigers killed was aid to be whilst army losses were put at the size of the attacking force was now claimed to be conveniently rationalizing the new casualty claim the number of wounded government troops was revised down to from the tigers were believed to have suffered wounded no basis was given for the new numbers a little later the government kia claim of was revised to and then again to the numbers were said to be changing as the troops moving into the shattered base were finding more bodies in fact the ministry of defense has a standard procedure for issuing casualty figures fundamentally the number of the ltte casualties are exaggerated while the number of government losses are played down an estimated number of ltte dead is stated along with the estimated size of the attacking force these numbers are then adjusted upwards as government casualty figures are released so as to maintain the impression that the ltte had been unsuccessful in its attack the number of government dead is gradually increased from a small number to a level that wont alarm the sinhalese public the number of tigers killed and the size of the attacking force is also increased so as to make the government casualty claims seem acceptable to the sinhala public to lend credibility to the claims of ltte casualties supposed intercepted transmissions are cited this has been standard practice for many years however the ltte has been able to successfully organise several large operations against the sri lankan military over the past year it begs the question why intercepted transmissions have never allowed the sri lankans to prepare their defenses against these these public relations procedures have been followed routinely in every engagement since the ltte overran the mullaitivu base in july its staggering losses left the government speechless and the resultant official silence fueled the publics rumor mill even in that battle the mod initially claimed that only - solders had been killed it was only when less than survivors made it to government lines that the loss of over soldiers was indirectly acknowledged: they are officially listed as missing the government claims it has killed over tigers during the current offensive in the vanni whilst losing soldiers it admits these are estimates of numbers that should have been killed in artillery and air strikes there have been few direct engagements the ltte have said that they have lost less than fighters in resisting the army offensive the sri lankan government is able to continue to issue fictitious casualty claims simply because it is certain they can never be independently verified: reporters have been banned from the tamil homelands for two years the ltte intensified its campaign for independence following the island wide pogrom against tamils in july over tamil civilians have been killed in the governments attempts to crush the tamil struggle in the elections the tamil people of the island voted overwhelmingly for parties supporting independence from sri lanka</th>\n",

it could not have escaped the mods notice that th brigade headquarters defenses were collapsing at the time nevertheless control of public perception seems to have been the overriding concern the sla spokesman sarath munesinghe was quoted as saying there were casualties on both sides and we still dont know the exact details shortly afterwards the mod issued its first casualty claim: sri lankans killed soldiers sailors and special forces commandos this was accompanied by a claim that ltte casualties had to be heavy though no basis was given this conclusion later this was qualified: tigers had been killed in addition the size of the attacking force was now stated to be late on tuesday the mod said that sri lankans had died and that terrorist transmissions indicated tigers had died the mod also said that sri lankans were wounded the situation was said to be under control and the troops were said to be engaged in clearing operations however vavuniya residents told news agency reporters that they could hear the sound of heavy fighting to the north including artillery thandikulum is a few miles north of vavuniya an aid worker told agency reporter that the ltte was still holding parts of thandikulum the road from vavuniya to thandikulum remained sealed military officials also admitted to agency reporters that the th brigade hq had been overrun the ltte issued a statement late on tuesday stating that its troops were still holding thandikulum it also stated that it had killed hundreds of soldiers whilst losing tigers on the following day the mod had a new set of numbers: the number of tigers killed was aid to be whilst army losses were put at the size of the attacking force was now claimed to be conveniently rationalizing the new casualty claim the number of wounded government troops was revised down to from the tigers were believed to have suffered wounded no basis was given for the new numbers a little later the government kia claim of was revised to and then again to the numbers were said to be changing as the troops moving into the shattered base were finding more bodies in fact the ministry of defense has a standard procedure for issuing casualty figures fundamentally the number of the ltte casualties are exaggerated while the number of government losses are played down an estimated number of ltte dead is stated along with the estimated size of the attacking force these numbers are then adjusted upwards as government casualty figures are released so as to maintain the impression that the ltte had been unsuccessful in its attack the number of government dead is gradually increased from a small number to a level that wont alarm the sinhalese public the number of tigers killed and the size of the attacking force is also increased so as to make the government casualty claims seem acceptable to the sinhala public to lend credibility to the claims of ltte casualties supposed intercepted transmissions are cited this has been standard practice for many years however the ltte has been able to successfully organise several large operations against the sri lankan military over the past year it begs the question why intercepted transmissions have never allowed the sri lankans to prepare their defenses against these these public relations procedures have been followed routinely in every engagement since the ltte overran the mullaitivu base in july its staggering losses left the government speechless and the resultant official silence fueled the publics rumor mill even in that battle the mod initially claimed that only - solders had been killed it was only when less than survivors made it to government lines that the loss of over soldiers was indirectly acknowledged: they are officially listed as missing the government claims it has killed over tigers during the current offensive in the vanni whilst losing soldiers it admits these are estimates of numbers that should have been killed in artillery and air strikes there have been few direct engagements the ltte have said that they have lost less than fighters in resisting the army offensive the sri lankan government is able to continue to issue fictitious casualty claims simply because it is certain they can never be independently verified: reporters have been banned from the tamil homelands for two years the ltte intensified its campaign for independence following the island wide pogrom against tamils in july over tamil civilians have been killed in the governments attempts to crush the tamil struggle in the elections the tamil people of the island voted overwhelmingly for parties supporting independence from sri lanka</th>\n",

as a compensation for the lives of their missing family members the delegates also rejected the term widows being applied to them each and every case of the missing persons should be investigated and traces of their whereabouts should be brought out with international assistance going beyond the parameters of the sri lankan state-controlled investigations and mechanisms ananthy sasitharan said [tamil] statement by ananthy sasitharan on international day for victims of enforced disappeared [english] statement by ananthy sasitharan on international day for victims of enforced disappeared further extracts from ananthy sasitharans speech follow: the sri lankan state brought out th amendment and made the political aspiration of eelam tamils into a crime and as a result state terrorism was born there are also other state actors who failed to admit the state terrorism of the sri lankan state but took a one-side stand by declaring the tamil side as terrorists these state actors are also accountable and are complicit in the genocide against tamils this is why there are also engaged in diluting the burning issue and are aiding the sri lankan state to continue to deviate from real accountability while recognizing most of the crimes as war crimes these international actors refuse to call the tamil prisoners as prisoners of war this also indicates a serious shortcoming in the existing international law and the human rights regime while the international community is reluctant to regard the tamil-speaking prisoners as prisoners of war the sri lankan state which engaged in state terrorism is refusing even the status of political prisoners to the tamil-speaking prisoners and detainees therefore the struggle for accountability on forcefully disappeared persons is a struggle against international injustice as well as it is being a struggle against the state that engaged in state terrorism and genocide it is precisely therefore it is a betrayal to the victims if we avoid their collective tamil identity </th>\n",
